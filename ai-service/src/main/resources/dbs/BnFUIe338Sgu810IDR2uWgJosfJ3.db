objects.","metadata":{"metadata":{"docId":"09_Design_Patterns_Part2.pdf"}}}},{"id":"fe970507-99c9-4794-93e4-50b44e633bca","embedding":{"vector":[0.0056511266,0.001160365,-0.033436652,-0.083301425,-0.040555224,-0.046721295,-0.015037036,-0.009604104,-0.107123755,-0.012995961,0.0058868746,-0.07484742,-0.008119276,4.3675784E-4,0.0779594,-0.067510456,0.008832025,-0.021410367,0.010556169,0.018148892,0.09316111,-0.027458025,-0.044198085,-0.0270577,-0.1252187,0.06184606,0.017437756,-0.066971265,0.09832382,-0.086864546,0.027920708,0.10230342,-0.02624125,0.015988149,-0.032301236,0.082689874,-0.0069059688,0.008985389,-0.0529406,-0.007977967,-0.0748765,-0.024571983,-0.00954007,-0.033381775,0.022382785,0.063050225,-0.027490472,-0.0429147,-0.011666374,-0.059414905,-0.044837523,0.014830366,-0.038482297,-0.040772866,0.07896461,0.080953896,0.092033856,0.01608855,-0.029149357,-0.029120544,-0.0023120423,0.02584121,-0.066422276,-0.0054879915,0.03445105,0.0901266,-0.06366764,0.039170522,0.045921784,-0.022580815,-0.076535106,-0.024816973,0.033185583,0.027455416,-0.009481879,0.035100896,-0.06492479,0.021815484,-0.02949419,-0.047617555,-0.030206129,0.013839702,-0.03530135,0.05129585,-0.008139315,0.001180293,-0.04511596,0.0538928,0.047057375,0.06618806,0.057081144,-0.021990208,0.055446163,-0.03654349,-0.08315871,0.027850416,-0.066379875,-0.050944727,0.045622043,-0.008806525,-0.003136845,-0.053851184,0.10714145,0.017577356,-0.012185075,0.01590217,-0.03592281,0.03698369,0.06361458,-0.012972874,-0.07205831,0.039330937,-0.03161324,-0.13851255,-0.06451477,-0.05762543,1.6160318E-5,-0.028744487,-0.024242891,0.058023583,0.14898662,0.0013870494,0.0466366,0.0130979605,0.033656828,-0.048118137,-0.11847957,1.3529026E-32,0.0045186807,-0.01585132,-0.057992034,0.06526864,0.06429271,0.022408027,0.055567577,0.04017238,-0.011211002,0.027484998,0.028837712,0.025761764,-0.08579549,0.10987832,0.0989662,-0.024027029,-0.011540681,0.012782947,0.031974915,-0.053331204,0.015980734,0.017424036,0.0485739,-0.016390616,0.12908378,0.03713785,0.057521347,-0.060825568,-0.13783652,0.013161024,0.037009086,-0.047904454,0.04150702,0.033682965,-0.0014907873,0.00636889,-0.004515827,-0.056421183,-0.0044467943,-0.07976549,-0.027346734,-0.07004238,-0.071809165,0.10748592,0.01387926,-0.05139214,0.058851834,0.012081401,0.0030624568,0.06698558,0.009999475,-0.015398539,0.085792154,0.011261606,-0.03938538,-0.032999776,-0.008648148,0.013519138,0.017642107,0.012633265,-0.040909328,0.08180918,-0.043103296,0.047599778,0.047219515,-0.026996298,0.009642917,-0.06532226,0.052153338,0.052420735,0.044258714,0.0077263066,-0.07881456,0.032378394,-0.040859092,0.0013264389,-0.038127318,0.004018738,-0.055018827,-0.011106397,-0.0762957,0.12434552,0.035924792,-0.020768192,-0.027175665,0.01561168,0.091802,-0.015967045,-0.0753933,0.011541176,0.052181557,-0.0574762,0.024810694,0.019365862,0.061736528,-1.3784783E-32,0.015533053,-0.03150018,-0.047129314,-0.07125443,0.06539013,-0.032013863,-0.067104444,-0.06787384,-0.06236941,0.070380315,-0.06333094,0.06677581,0.06176278,-0.004944836,-0.013148083,-0.00388499,0.0014598913,-0.06608296,0.06552568,0.057240512,0.018243628,0.06354671,-0.087333605,-0.0044194423,-0.014382808,0.009259944,-0.028141132,-0.012981266,0.034676086,0.0024939657,-0.08755088,-0.0821946,0.061573457,0.024413368,0.07262309,0.014057732,-0.011038112,0.06483179,-0.026889876,-0.023899522,-0.034825265,-0.016740397,-9.432392E-4,0.0077981814,-0.02468062,-0.035105936,-0.068919316,0.027216898,-0.023618769,-0.06651046,0.0037212688,0.007202149,-0.024936112,-0.051028833,0.006354942,0.041174088,0.09847989,-0.052272897,-0.085950166,0.06864247,0.09734244,-0.04211179,-0.020145385,-0.024416856,0.027892882,-0.06980294,-0.029035447,-0.07391068,-0.086523876,-0.024168802,-0.012224315,-0.024042847,-0.08303654,0.025332786,-0.0398201,-0.04520173,0.00946647,0.043115936,0.009646329,0.086600944,-0.009738016,0.00399634,0.0421244,0.03367254,-0.03129586,-0.004537167,0.04762579,0.087413594,0.06935378,0.030132374,-0.033509392,0.057786137,-0.032952953,0.10935775,-0.02283623,-4.837957E-8,-0.046894323,-0.0956676,0.048158016,-0.036735624,-0.04408429,-9.570593E-4,0.007200312,-0.057165444,-0.076193966,-0.068519376,-0.0060347174,-0.03462357,-0.06058285,0.044356566,0.12203602,-0.019911738,-0.061569795,0.03053949,-0.12121371,-0.016745131,0.03316582,-0.035289746,-0.040881153,0.034929514,-0.025639717,-0.01857134,-0.038402364,-0.032913547,0.06510304,0.06951977,0.011541027,0.05081659,-0.017583292,-0.0059725484,0.031055428,0.06368412,0.0027041652,0.011359164,0.054072954,-0.011515068,0.021682324,-0.052701768,-0.013022988,0.046781573,0.0512626,0.055276733,-0.01803882,-0.080672175,0.04345083,-0.0047068293,-0.03406163,0.03363253,-0.10064595,0.074627966,-0.019102167,0.013868693,0.057998195,-0.06865725,0.08504928,-0.03026939,0.04426784,0.052775893,0.038251646,0.021649588]},"embedded":{"text":"4\nClassification

do we need Adapter Design Pattern? • Enables communication between incompatible systems. • Reuses existing code or libraries without rewriting. • Simplifies integration of new components, keeping the system \nflexible. 21\nAdapter\n22\nBenefits\n▪ Adaptees added/used without changes to existing code. Liabilities\n▪ The overall complexity of the code increases because we add new \nclasses and a level of indirection.

subtasks.","metadata":{"metadata":{"docId":"09_Design_Patterns_Part2.pdf"}}}},{"id":"19f20f89-fc20-420d-bd55-6497512d6d55","embedding":{"vector":[-0.027277209,0.06357064,-0.014857302,-0.0080757225,-0.02602241,0.052015692,-0.017784946,0.051869806,-0.06294962,0.03335028,-0.0023938778,-0.03703203,0.060034167,0.04208802,0.04409915,-0.054158714,0.024660056,-0.041061852,0.0162868,-0.078179315,0.09587522,-0.03370294,-0.017071504,-0.0037190965,-0.00624403,0.11032146,-0.004338335,-0.076626174,0.054344416,-0.04240159,0.005508191,0.04363972,0.045937646,0.064674884,-0.064804226,0.0626095,-0.057342947,0.04157042,-6.881203E-4,-0.07872928,0.0014343159,-0.065304935,-0.055372857,-0.07108941,-0.019817147,-0.060900602,-0.069815464,-0.0770974,0.026014574,-0.005161504,-0.07580418,-0.050420187,0.0078451615,0.014879128,0.07972283,0.053623226,-0.027808623,0.045110192,0.032162882,0.008949652,0.0017416327,-0.035486758,-0.039347112,-0.019679634,0.09235318,-0.0080598565,-0.013121427,-0.017963387,0.038862713,-0.055949014,-0.058456548,0.047174167,0.036840264,-0.039820015,-0.018573383,-0.008295653,-0.07866491,-0.03088214,-0.063524626,-0.033690754,-0.021963447,0.03184727,-0.046964534,0.034928124,0.08407832,0.08034618,-0.06328744,-0.029746406,-0.051202446,-0.02015424,-0.020634523,-0.12052943,-0.013961262,4.9995235E-4,-0.027279256,0.03982447,-0.0059661516,0.008685501,-0.0044312784,0.02002678,0.024462588,-0.015373709,0.06305322,0.008919002,0.0032957897,-0.04575424,-0.07550748,-0.004071621,-0.017812023,-0.054093022,-0.014878828,0.0018447622,-0.06266978,-0.02742543,-0.034991156,-0.09949878,0.050567143,0.013451345,0.07667674,0.100859314,0.09630856,0.008162376,0.001100268,-0.047227822,-0.001430466,0.061202984,0.0031701217,4.8398563E-33,0.06458477,0.018707534,0.031971868,0.0072756894,0.04655162,-0.049178883,-0.01628892,0.0666576,0.05106103,-0.0116356965,0.058740202,-0.0051268185,9.2408573E-4,0.054521088,0.004742503,-0.023846524,0.036869388,0.031239942,-0.022771211,-0.025321666,-0.005990761,0.06924348,-0.038025565,-0.0031725431,-0.0062635113,0.05748258,0.071408495,-0.03653989,-0.11553841,0.016172728,0.095499046,-0.0131766675,0.014167446,0.123592705,0.013989556,0.03350641,0.08059519,-0.017830433,-0.007135335,-0.090622276,-0.02775031,0.0018512165,-0.008251839,0.067007124,0.053318553,-0.08086672,0.02964193,0.058894027,0.060456585,0.04400718,0.015537579,0.025964398,0.036884423,-0.06734222,0.039583277,0.032808106,0.02401553,0.06903284,0.031405967,0.05108258,-0.06742244,0.025541889,-0.11597903,0.08231237,0.010849366,0.07787722,-0.061321102,-0.06739669,0.012428027,0.015884334,0.012991321,0.018878093,-0.03094928,0.0091248825,0.09317887,-0.01236898,-0.030036062,-0.09902995,-0.10586552,-0.019433234,-0.023023948,0.03716483,0.023102127,0.06522741,-0.0746932,0.10151666,-0.0058226464,0.044685494,0.0030001348,-0.024640406,0.0017683078,7.170115E-4,-0.0062614884,-9.669204E-4,0.05491771,-4.1278384E-33,0.045202352,0.064808644,-0.10362545,-0.042127717,0.07668792,-0.031416632,0.039245363,-0.06957341,-0.091368675,0.09472021,-0.04717541,-0.0035701839,-0.023285791,-0.0042676693,-0.076397486,0.023188218,0.003259063,0.057259727,-0.010041272,-0.01452153,-0.042005483,0.11013988,0.004037514,-0.0015270279,0.08301114,-0.039339356,0.01853959,0.034969382,0.03270543,-9.45026E-4,0.006124016,-0.08493014,0.081836686,-0.027818663,-0.023387257,-0.010680176,-0.054354057,0.019758679,-0.04316629,0.005619949,0.0036804893,-0.030648641,0.007266978,0.06696785,0.020860618,-0.067310534,-0.048113797,0.0071065547,-0.015835388,-0.0030008545,-0.01216108,-0.088017285,-0.08084902,-0.061886422,0.03635366,-0.007678236,0.04785429,-0.0012078024,-0.050370328,0.0015980917,0.057444043,0.0031663699,0.038140193,0.011339968,0.14169014,-0.05025842,-0.055675752,-0.076606005,0.04314826,-0.06669166,0.022305192,0.004656475,-0.0081292,-0.03386226,0.10698887,-0.02106464,-0.0012203619,0.08828819,-0.01028484,0.07585966,-0.0435322,-0.044100635,-0.0055746813,-0.0212582,-0.020511596,-0.0030315851,0.045412373,0.1277093,-0.03210808,0.047064334,2.8739587E-4,0.10025803,-0.012134254,0.0708864,0.020809306,-4.141921E-8,-0.004759511,-0.09515608,-0.05351989,-0.023392078,0.0488381,-0.013304522,-0.03406375,-0.046745505,0.029757105,-3.0400956E-4,-0.02040409,-0.027555732,-0.028104644,-0.010528895,0.13579188,-0.061010286,0.090390205,0.060857087,-0.095473185,0.02532054,0.027801013,-0.036795184,-0.09914888,-0.001985128,0.0095454445,-5.854941E-4,0.0147871645,0.05392239,0.05272409,0.055387296,-0.03537402,0.050504755,-0.020319631,-0.05295069,-0.06439367,0.020972649,0.028102845,0.012155419,0.04044936,0.057181768,0.03117965,-0.063671164,-0.027707122,0.019107087,-0.009102916,0.030652232,-0.053750668,-0.07909056,-0.003875801,-0.016702158,-0.11902306,-0.057365958,-0.03050655,0.007868126,-0.013042462,0.02854447,0.15250844,-0.1430104,0.022674564,-0.06718231,0.08560041,0.071667,-9.19985E-4,0.045545157]},"embedded":{"text":"31\nComposite

Client Simplification – Provides a unified way to handle complex \nstructures efficiently. 36\nComposite\n37\nBenefits\n▪ Makes the clients simple. Clients can treat composite structures and \nindividual objects uniformly. ▪ Makes it easier to add new kinds of components. Newly defined \nComposite or Leaf subclasses work automatically with existing \nstructures and client code. Liabilities\n▪ Can make your design too general. The disadvantage of making it easy \nto add new components is that it makes it harder to restrict the \ncomponents of a composite.

Generics are a feature in Java that allows classes, interfaces, and methods to \noperate on types specified as parameters. • Before Java 5, developers often used the Object type to handle generic data
