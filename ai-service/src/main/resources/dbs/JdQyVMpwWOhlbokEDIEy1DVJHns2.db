Generics are a feature in Java that allows classes, interfaces, and methods to \noperate on types specified as parameters. • Before Java 5, developers often used the Object type to handle generic data \nstructures. Generics\nExample: Stack class\npublic class Stack {\n    private Object[] objects;\n    public Stack() {……}\n    // Add element to Stack\n    public void push(Object object) { ... }\n    // Retrieve and remove top element\n    public Object pop() { ... }\n}\nStack s \u003d new Stack();\n// Since Stack can hold any type (Object is parent of all classes):\ns.push(\"Ahmed\");\ns.push(new Student(123456, 23));\ns.push(new Complex());\nGenerics\n• When popping elements, Java doesn’t know the real type. • The programmer must specify the type manually. String s \u003d (String) s.pop(); // OK if Stack holds a String\nint v \u003d ((Student) s.pop()).getId(); // OK if Stack holds a Student\nGenerics\n• Before Java 5, we use the Object type to handle
