The \"scan path\" in this context refers to the sequential process-\ning and interpretation of ECG waveforms, which often involve nested patterns and hierarchical\nstructures that traditional finite automata cannot adequately model due to their limited mem-\nory. 2 RESEARCH QUESTION\nHow can we complete the scan path of ECG using a push down automaton?

CHOSEN FORMAL MODEL\nModel: Pushdown Automaton (PDA)\nJustification: We have selected the Pushdown Automaton because clinical ECG interpretation\nis inherently hierarchical, not just linear. Experts often initiate a \"sub-routine\" (e.g., examining\nthe QRS complex) which creates a nested expectation to examine related features (e.g., the T-\nwave) before returning to the main viewing sequence. A simple Finite State Automaton (FSA)\nlacks the memory to efficiently track these unfinished tasks, whereas a PDA’s stack provides a\nnatural \"To-Do\" list structure, allowing us to model the completion of nested diagnostic tasks. 4 PRELIMINARY APPROACH\nOur primary goal is to build a \"Scanpath Auto-Complete\" system. The PDA will process a\nsequence of eye fixations as input symbols, transitioning states while manipulating the stack to\nreflect the physician’s current cognitive load. 1\nPROJECT PROPOSAL

example, transitioning to\nthe QRS_Analysis state will PUSH an Expect_Repolarization symbol onto the stack. • Completion Logic: Given a partial scanpath (an incomplete string w), we will run the PDA\nuntil it halts.

Plan (Synthesized Data): If specific 12-lead ECG eye-tracking data is unavailable,\nwe will generate a synthetic dataset. We will use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\nsymbolic sequences that adhere to standard medical guidelines (e.g., the \"Rate-Rhythm-Axis-\nHypertrophy-Ischemia\" method) to simulate expert scanpaths, and insert random deviations\nto simulate novice or interrupted scanpaths. 6 EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND SUCCESS CRITERIA\nWe define project success by the following outcomes:\n1. Functional PDA Implementation: A working algorithm that accepts a symbolic scanpath\nstring and maintains a stack trace. 2.

Validity: The generated completions must follow logical medical rules (e.g., one\ncannot check the PR interval without first looking at the P-wave). 7 POTENTIAL CHALLENGES\n• Data Discretization: Raw eye-tracking data consists of (x, y) coordinates. Mapping these\nnoisy continuous values to discrete semantic symbols (e.g., \"Looking at Lead II\") will require\nrobust preprocessing to avoid feeding \"junk\" symbols into the PDA. • Unbounded Stack Growth: If the PDA design is too recursive, the stack might grow indef-\ninitely (a stack overflow). We will mitigate this by designing strict pop-rules to ensure the\nstack clears efficiently, even if the user skips a step. • Variability of Experts: Different doctors may use different valid strategies. A single deter-\nministic PDA might reject a valid but alternative strategy. We may need to explore Non-\nDeterministic PDAs (NPDA) to account for multiple valid completion paths.

6: All calculator tests passed (4 tests total shown)\nFigure 7: Complete test suite with divide by zero test (5 tests total)\n2.5 Key Learnings from Exercise 1\n• The Arrange-Act-Assert pattern makes tests clear and organized\n• assertEquals verifies expected vs actual values\n4\n• assertThrows checks that exceptions are thrown correctly\n• Unit tests can catch bugs immediately when code is modified\n3 Exercise 2: Temperature Regulator\n3.1 Problem Description\nThis exercise tests a temperature control system that decides between HEAT, COOL,\nor STANDBY based on current and target temperatures. The specification defines a\ntolerance zone of ±0.5°C around the target temperature:\n• If current \u003c target - 0.5, then action is HEAT\n• If current \u003e target + 0.5, then action is COOL\n• Otherwise, action is STANDBY\n3.2 Boundary Value Analysis\nBoundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a testing technique that focuses on values at the edges\nof input
