symbols\nFinding a backdoor in a FOSS binary through bindiffing\nOverview  \nEvilbox is a Medium reversing challenge. It contains a backdoored version of the popular BusyBox FOSS shell. \nPlayers should use tools such as FLIRT/Sigkit to recreate a symbolized build of the software and build a \nfunction identification database, and then use binary diffing tools such as Bindiff/Diaspora to find the \nbackdoor function.\nSolution  \nPreliminary Analysis  \nAs the description of the challenge implies, we have a backdoored Busybox build. On the remote end, the \nplayer is dropped in a low-privileged shell. The goal is to escalate to root privileges with the backdoor. Let\u0027s \nfirst try to find some build information. The binary itself is dynamically linked and stripped. Players are also \nprovided a config file.\nRunning Busybox alone informs us of a version hint: BusyBox v1.36.1337.Volyana67 () multi-call \nbinary.  It is most likely a 1.36 build of Busybox. We can also figure out the compiler version from the \n.comment section, which mentions GCC: (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0 . Now, we can create a \nsimilar build of Busybox with the given config.\nBuilding Function Signature Database  \nThe Github mirror shows a branch called 1_36_stable, which will be sufficient for this challenge: \nhttps://github.com/mirror/busybox/tree/1_36_stable.\nFor this writeup, I will be using Binary Ninja with SigKit and Bindiff. After building with gcc-11 on Ubuntu 22.04 \nusing the provided config, we can open it up in Binja. As noted in the description, optimization for compilation \nwas disabled (to make the challenge easier). One can go to Makefile.flags  and perform the following \nchange to achieve this:\nLet the analysis run through on the busybox_unstripped  build analysis, and then run Generate Signature \nLibrary from Plugins -\u003e Signature Library.\nThen we bring the signature accordingly into the Binja directories, open the provided busybox, and wait for the \nsignatures to be applied. \ndiff --git a/Makefile.flags b/Makefile.flags\nindex 1cec5ba20..0db646123 100644\n--- a/Makefile.flags\n+++ b/Makefile.flags\n@@ -87,14 +87,14 @@ endif\n #CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-Wconversion,)\n \n ifneq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG),y)\n-CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-Oz,$(call cc-option,-Os,$(call cc-option,-O2,)))\n+CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-O0,)\n else\n CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-g,)\n #CFLAGS +\u003d \"-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE\u003d2\"\n ifeq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG_PESSIMIZE),y)\n CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-O0,)\n else\n-CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-Oz,$(call cc-option,-Os,$(call cc-option,-O2,)))\n+CFLAGS +\u003d $(call cc-option,-O0,)\n endif\n endif\n ifeq ($(CONFIG_DEBUG_SANITIZE),y)\nYou should see many function signatures populate afterwards\nBindiffing  \nFor BinDiffing, we need to first setup BinExport in Binja to export the required data. Now, for whatever reason, \nBinExport is notoriously hard to install for Binja, and you pretty much have to manually build the plugin (and \nthe API compatibility breaks somewhat frequently). Refer to this gist for setup.\nWe then make a new workspace in BinDiff, and just import the 2 BinDiff files (the unstripped one acted as the \nprimary, while the provided one acted as the secondary). Then open the BinDiff result in Binary Ninja with the \nBinDiff Viewer Plugin. BinDiff will allow us to also easily check the diffs in disassembly (but there does seem to \nbe some mistakes). I believe IDA supports this natively as well as decompilation diffing.\nHere is our preliminary results in both BinDiff and the Binja plugin.\nWow! 99% similarity! Only run_applet_no_and_exit  and mod  look a bit more different.\nIn the Busybox we built, run_applet_no_and_exit  looked like this:\nWhat Bindiff matched as run_applet_no_and_exit  looked like the following:\ndata_847b6 is the string \"dc\". In the given config file, CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID  is enabled. According to Busybox \ndocumentation, this means that given a Busybox with the SUID bit set, it will drop the SUID bit whenever \nexecuting an applet that doesn\u0027t require SUID permissions. Indeed, this behavior can be verified in source. \nFrom source, we also know that the second argument is the name of the applet. Effectively, this function has \nbeen patched to not drop SUID for the dc  applet, an RPN calculator (which definitely does not need SUID bit). \nThis implies that the backdoor will be hiding in dc  relevant code.\nmod  in the busybox we built look like the following:\n00008d4a  void run_applet_no_and_exit(int32_t arg1, uint64_t arg2, int64_t* arg3) \n__noreturn\n00008d67      applet_name \u003d arg2\n00008d7c      show_usage_if_dash_dash_help(arg1, arg3)\n00008d87      check_suid(arg1)\n00008dc6      xfunc_error_retval \u003d (\u0026applet_main)[sx.q(arg1)]\n(zx.q(string_array_len(arg3)), arg3)\n00008dcc      xfunc_die()\n00008dcc      noreturn\n00008d4a  void run_applet_no_and_exit(int32_t arg1, char* arg2, int64_t* arg3) __noreturn\n00008d67      data_900b0 \u003d arg2\n00008d7c      show_usage_if_dash_dash_help(arg1, arg3)\n00008d7c      \n00008d9a      if (strcmp(arg2, \u0026data_847b6) !\u003d 0)\n00008da2          check_suid(arg1)\n00008da2      \n00008de1      data_90010 \u003d (\u0026data_8f170)[sx.q(arg1)](zx.q(string_array_len(arg3)), arg3)\n00008de7      sub_9b78()\n00008de7      noreturn\n0000e0e5  uint64_t mod()\n0000e0ed      double zmm0 \u003d pop()\n0000e0fa      int64_t var_10\n0000e0fa      \n0000e0fa      if (zmm0 \u003e\u003d 9.2233720368547758e+18)\n0000e128          var_10 \u003d int.q(zmm0 - 9.2233720368547758e+18) ^ 0x8000000000000000\n0000e0fa      else\n0000e101          var_10 \u003d int.q(zmm0)\n0000e101      \n0000e13d      if (var_10 \u003d\u003d 0)\n0000e149          bb_simple_error_msg()\n0000e14e          pop()\n0000e15f          return push(0)\n0000e15f      \n0000e166      double zmm0_2 \u003d pop()\n0000e173      int64_t rax_4\nWhat BinDiff matched as mod looked like the following:\n0000e173      \n0000e173      if (zmm0_2 \u003e\u003d 9.2233720368547758e+18)\n0000e197          rax_4 \u003d int.q(zmm0_2 - 9.2233720368547758e+18) ^ 0x8000000000000000\n0000e173      else\n0000e175          rax_4 \u003d int.q(zmm0_2)\n0000e175      \n0000e19f      uint64_t temp1_1 \u003d modu.dp.q(0:rax_4, var_10)\n0000e1aa      double rax_7\n0000e1aa      \n0000e1aa      if (temp1_1 s\u003c 0)\n0000e1cc          zmm0_2 \u003d float.d(temp1_1 u\u003e\u003e 1 | zx.q(temp1_1.d \u0026 1))\n0000e1d5          rax_7 \u003d zmm0_2 + zmm0_2\n0000e1aa      else\n0000e1b5          rax_7 \u003d float.d(temp1_1)\n0000e1b5      \n0000e1df      return push(rax_7)\n0000e4ae  uint64_t sub_e4ae()\n0000e4b6      sub_e022()\n0000e4bb      double zmm0 \u003d sub_e336()\n0000e4c8      int64_t var_10\n0000e4c8      \n0000e4c8      if (zmm0 \u003e\u003d 9.2233720368547758e+18)\n0000e4f6          var_10 \u003d int.q(zmm0 - 9.2233720368547758e+18) ^ 0x8000000000000000\n0000e4c8      else\n0000e4cf          var_10 \u003d int.q(zmm0)\n0000e4cf      \n0000e50b      if (var_10 \u003d\u003d 0)\n0000e517          sub_9b1e()\n0000e51c          sub_e336()\n0000e52d          return sub_e2e2(0)\n0000e52d      \n0000e534      double zmm0_2 \u003d sub_e336()\n0000e541      int64_t rax_4\n0000e541      \n0000e541      if (zmm0_2 \u003e\u003d 9.2233720368547758e+18)\n0000e565          rax_4 \u003d int.q(zmm0_2 - 9.2233720368547758e+18) ^ 0x8000000000000000\n0000e541      else\n0000e543          rax_4 \u003d int.q(zmm0_2)\n0000e543      \n0000e56d      uint64_t temp1_1 \u003d modu.dp.q(0:rax_4, var_10)\n0000e578      double rax_7\n0000e578      \n0000e578      if (temp1_1 s\u003c 0)\n0000e59a          zmm0_2 \u003d float.d(temp1_1 u\u003e\u003e 1 | zx.q(temp1_1.d \u0026 1))\n0000e5a3          rax_7 \u003d zmm0_2 + zmm0_2\n0000e578      else\n0000e583          rax_7 \u003d float.d(temp1_1)\n0000e583      \n0000e5ad      return sub_e2e2(rax_7)\nNote the extra call to sub_e022 .

We can also clearly see the call to \nhush_main  with /bin/sh  as the argument with the setuid  and setgid  calls, making this clearly the \nbackdoor. Lastly, the _mm_and_pd  is computed on the difference between 2 doubles and 0x7fffffffffffffff - the \nintrinsic is for bitwise AND, so this is clearing the sign bit of the difference (the absolute value function).\nHere is the code cleaned up:\n0000e281                  \n0000e28a                  char const* const var_128 \u003d \"/bin/sh\"\n0000e28f                  int64_t var_120 \u003d 0\n0000e29d                  setuid(uid: 0)\n0000e2a7                  setgid(gid: 0)\n0000e2b9                  hush_main(1, \u0026var_128)\n0000e2b9                  noreturn\n0000e2b9              \n0000e1a3              uint64_t var_130_1 \u003d (\u0026data_900e8)[zx.q(var_138_1)]\n0000e1a3              \n0000e1bb              if (var_130_1 f\u003e 0x3ff0000000000000)\n0000e1bb                  break\n0000e1bb              \n0000e1cf              if (-0x4010000000000000 f\u003e var_130_1)\n0000e1cf                  break\n0000e1cf              \n0000e1d5              int32_t rbx_1 \u003d var_13c_1\n0000e1dc              var_13c_1 \u003d rbx_1 + 1\n0000e1fb              *(\u0026s + (zx.q(rbx_1) \u003c\u003c 3)) \u003d sub_df34(0x3e8, var_130_1).q\n0000e200              var_138_1 +\u003d 1\n0000e200      \n0000e2d2      if (rax \u003d\u003d *(fsbase + 0x28))\n0000e2e1          return rax - *(fsbase + 0x28)\n0000e2e1      \n0000e2d4      __stack_chk_fail()\n0000e2d4      noreturn\n0000e022  int64_t sub_e022()\n0000e02e      void* fsbase\n0000e02e      int64_t rax \u003d *(fsbase + 0x28)\n0000e053      double s[0x10]\n0000e053      __builtin_memset(\u0026s, c: 0, n: 0x80)\n0000e05e      double var_98[0x10]\n0000e05e      var_98[0] \u003d 0x3fe68b3700474d9c\n0000e06f      var_98[1] \u003d -0x40614a0a0f4d7add\n0000e080      var_98[2] \u003d -0x401c3e35c5b4aa97\n0000e091      var_98[3] \u003d 0x3fce2656abde3fbc\n0000e0a2      var_98[4] \u003d -0x403a72324c836651\n0000e0b3      var_98[5] \u003d -0x404b9042d8c2a455\n0000e0c4      var_98[6] \u003d 0x3fca7eb6bf444e0e\n0000e0d5      var_98[7] \u003d -0x4016e0114d2f5dbc\n0000e0e6      var_98[8] \u003d -0x40467c17a89331a1\n0000e0f7      var_98[9] \u003d 0x3fca7eb6bf444e0e\n0000e108      var_98[0xa] \u003d 0x3fce2656abde3fbc\n0000e119      var_98[0xb] \u003d -0x401bd24e160d887f\n0000e12a      var_98[0xc] \u003d 0x3fe6e965f5275eea\n0000e13b      var_98[0xd] \u003d -0x404e1bf37b8d3f18\n0000e14c      var_98[0xe] \u003d 0x3fe91feeb2d0a244\n0000e15d      var_98[0xf] \u003d -0x40175ac258d5842b\n0000e15d      \n0000e172      if (stacklen_900e0 u\u003e 0xf)\n0000e178          int32_t var_13c_1 \u003d 0\n0000e18c          int32_t var_138_1 \u003d stacklen_900e0 - 0x10\n0000e18c          \n0000e212          while (true)\n0000e212              if (var_138_1 u\u003e\u003d stacklen_900e0)\n0000e218                  char var_13d_1 \u003d 1\n0000e218                  \n0000e27a                  for (int32_t i \u003d 0; i u\u003c\u003d 0xf; i +\u003d 1)\n0000e243                      uint128_t zmm0\n0000e243                      zmm0.q \u003d s[zx.q(i)] f- zx.o(var_98[zx.q(i)])[0]\n0000e25f                      uint64_t rax_10\n0000e25f                      rax_10.b \u003d 0.0001 f\u003e _mm_and_pd(zx.o(0x7fffffffffffffff), \nzmm0)[0]\n0000e269                      uint32_t rax_12\n0000e269                      rax_12.b \u003d (zx.d(rax_10.b) \u0026 zx.d(var_13d_1)) !\u003d 0\n0000e26c                      var_13d_1 \u003d rax_12.b\n0000e26c                  \n0000e281                  if (var_13d_1 \u003d\u003d 0)\n0000e281                      break\n0000e281                  \n0000e28a                  char* var_128[0x2]\n0000e28a                  var_128[0] \u003d \"/bin/sh\"\n0000e28f                  var_128[1] \u003d 0\n0000e29d                  setuid(uid: 0)\n0000e2a7                  setgid(gid: 0)\n0000e2b9                  hush_main(1, \u0026var_128)\n0000e2b9                  noreturn\n0000e2b9              \n0000e1a3              uint64_t var_130_1 \u003d (\u0026stack_900e8)[zx.q(var_138_1)]\n0000e1a3              \n0000e1bb              if (var_130_1 f\u003e zx.o(1)[0])\n0000e1bb                  break\n0000e1bb              \n0000e1cf              if (-1 f\u003e var_130_1)\n0000e1cf                  break\n0000e1cf              \n0000e1d5              int32_t rbx_1 \u003d var_13c_1\n0000e1dc              var_13c_1 \u003d rbx_1 + 1\n0000e1fb              s[zx.q(rbx_1)] \u003d sub_df34(0x3e8, var_130_1).q\n0000e200              var_138_1 +\u003d 1\n0000e200      \n0000e2d2      if (rax \u003d\u003d *(fsbase + 0x28))\n0000e2e1          return rax - *(fsbase + 0x28)\nThis backdoor ensures that the stack length is at least 16 in length, and that all the last 16 inputs are between \n-1 and 1. For each character, it stores the result of sub_df34. The results of these computation have to equal \nthe series of floats in var_98.\nLet us now take a look at sub_df34 :\nThis might be a confusing function to look at, but if you break it down, you will arrive at the following pseudo \ncode:\nFor those in the know, this is just the Taylor/Maclaurin series expansion of the arctan(x) function (I hope you \nremember your calculus). This is why the stack inputs were bounded to be close to 0. In fact, even ChatGPT 4o \ncan deduce this, and o1 can figure this out without any fiddling or further prompting.\nTriggering the Backdoor  \nWe can use tangent to thus derive the flag then.
